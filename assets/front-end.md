Front End Web Developer interview questions
This Front End Web Developer interview profile brings together a snapshot of what to look for in
candidates with a balanced sample of suitable interview questions.

In some respects even the most technical role demands qualities common to strong candidates for
all positions: the willingness to learn; qualified skills; passion for the job.

Even college performance, while it helps you to assess formal education, doesnʼt give a complete
picture. This is not to underplay the importance of a solid background in computer science. Some
things to look for:

Understanding of basic algorithmic concepts
Discuss basic algorithms, how would they find/think/sort
Can they show a wider understanding of databases
Do they have an approach to modelling?
Do they stay up to date with the latest developments? If so, how? Probe for their favourite technical
books. Who are they following on Twitter, which blogs do they turn to?

Are they active on Github? Do they contribute to any open source software projects? Or take part
in Hackathons. In short, how strong is their intellectual interest in their chosen field? How is this
demonstrated? Ask for side projects (like game development). Committed, inquisitive candidates
will stand out.
